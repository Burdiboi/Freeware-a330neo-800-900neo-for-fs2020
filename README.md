# Freeware-a330neo-800-900neo-for-fs2020
This is a project I am endevoring to make a freeware airbus a330neo family for fs2020. The a330neo is a widebody family of planes developed by Airbus in Toulouse France that is an upgrade to the airbus a330ceo family. The differences between the a330neo and the a330ceo family is that the a330neo has the new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and brand new sharklets (similar to the a350 family), which makes the a330neo 14% more fuel efficient than the a330ceo. There are 2 variants, the 800 (shorter, less passengers, longer range) with a range of 8150 nautical miles, and the 900 (longer, more passengers, shorter range) with a range of 7200 nautical miles.
